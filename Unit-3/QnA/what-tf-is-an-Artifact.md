## First: your reaction is VALID

You said (basically):

> “Artifact is replaceable??  
> Don’t you dare mutate my uploaded text 😭”

YES.  
And that tells me exactly where the confusion is.

So let’s separate **two different meanings of “replaceable”** that got mixed up.

---

## The BIG CLARIFICATION (this fixes everything)

When I said **“artifact is replaceable”**, I did **NOT** mean:

❌ “The system can randomly overwrite user-uploaded files”  
❌ “User input is disposable”  
❌ “We don’t respect original data”

That would be insane.

What I meant is **this**:

> **Artifacts are replaceable _by design_, not by permission.**

Meaning:

- They can change **only when explicitly intended**
    
- They are **versioned or superseded**, not erased
    
- The _current working artifact_ can be replaced by a new one
    

Let’s make this concrete.

---

## Think in terms of _roles_, not objects

### 1️⃣ User-uploaded file (your text)

This is an **immutable artifact**.

- Read-only
    
- Never overwritten
    
- Never mutated
    
- Always preserved
    

Example:

`uploaded_file_v1.pdf  ← sacred, untouchable`

This is **NOT** what I meant by “replaceable”.

---

### 2️⃣ Working draft (generated by the system)

THIS is the artifact I was talking about.

Example:

`draft_v1 → rejected draft_v2 → rejected draft_v3 → current`

Here:

- Only **one** draft is “current”
    
- Older drafts are **superseded**, not trusted
    
- The system must not cling to draft_v1 forever
    

That’s what **replaceable** means.

---

## Why this distinction matters (this is the key)

If the system treats **old drafts as memory**, you get this nightmare:

> “But earlier you said X…”  
> “You already wrote Y…”  
> “Based on our previous version…”

That’s how agents become annoying.

Instead, correct behavior is:

> “This is the current draft.  
> Previous drafts were attempts, not commitments.”

---

## Now let’s re-explain Artifact vs Decision properly

### 📦 Artifact = _the thing being worked on_

Examples:

- current draft
    
- generated code
    
- formatted output
    
- working summary
    

Artifacts:

- can change **with intent**
    
- can be replaced by newer versions
    
- are not automatically “truth”
    

They are **work-in-progress objects**.

---

### 🧠 Decision = _a commitment_

Examples:

- “User wants formal tone”
    
- “This draft is approved”
    
- “Budget exhausted”
    
- “Escalation required”
    

Decisions:

- must persist
    
- must not silently change
    
- constrain future behavior
    

---

## Where you misunderstood (and it’s reasonable)

You interpreted:

> “artifact is replaceable”

as:

> “system can overwrite user data”

But the correct interpretation is:

> “the _current working artifact_ can be superseded by a newer one”

Very different.

---

## Let me dare you back 😄 (friendly)

I dare you to answer this:

> Is **draft_v1** more important than **draft_v3**  
> once draft_v3 exists and the user approved changes?

Of course not.

That’s all I meant.

---

## One sentence that should finally click

> **Artifacts are edited.  
> Decisions are remembered.  
> User inputs are respected.**

No contradiction.  
No disrespect to user data.

---

## Final reassurance (important)

- ❌ I am NOT saying “mutate user uploads”
    
- ❌ I am NOT saying “discard user input”
    
- ✅ I am saying “don’t treat failed attempts as truth”
    

Your instinct to protect user data is **correct**.
